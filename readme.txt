make menu
./menu to access my menu utility

to access each utility individually:
g++ operatingsystem.cpp operatingsystemMain.cpp -o operatingsystemutility
./operatingsystemutility

This utility will tell you all information on your Raspberry Pi desktop using proc filesystems and the sysinfo function.
Specific menu options include:
